# SORTING-VISUALIZER
Sorting Visualizer is a web application for visualizing a bunch of different sorting algorithms Like Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort With the functionality of (Speed Control) and (Array Size Control)...

## Getting Started
Sorting is a very classic problem of reordering items (that can be compared, e.g., integers, floating-point numbers, strings, etc) of an array (or a list) in a certain order (increasing, decreasing, lexicographical, etc).

## Algorithms Used in this project:

   1. Bubble Sort,
   2. Selection Sort,
   3. Insertion Sort,
   4. Merge Sort,
   5. Quick Sort,
   6. Heap Sort

## Motivation
When an (integer) array A is sorted, many problems involving A become easy (or easier):

* Searching for a specific value v in array A,
* Finding the min/max or the k-th smallest/largest value in (static) array A,
* Testing for uniqueness and deleting duplicates in array A,
* Counting how many time a specific value v appear in array A,
* Counting how many values in array A is inside range [lo..hi], etc.
